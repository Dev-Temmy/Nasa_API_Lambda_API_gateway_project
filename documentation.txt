1. I started by creating html file for the frontend that 
will accept:
i. A start date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
ii. An end date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
iii. A Boolean that returns only the Hazardous objects

This will also hold my script that will make a request to the API.


2. I used AWS SAM to create Lambda and API gateway.
- using 'sam init'
-select Nodejs as preferred language
-

Problem encountered
1. Upgrading nodejs version on windows(i.e. 8.5.2)
- there was an error when I tried to create react app using the old version of npm(8.3.1)\

Solution
a)I firstly installed the new version of nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
b) npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org
c)  npm i -g npm-upgrade

3. Cors issues
I was trying to make an API call through Axios in my React Application. However, I am getting this CORS issue on my browser.

Solution
I solved it by creating a proxy server(to serve as middleware between client and the API Website)
